                   <p class="card-text">
                    The total amount of Bitcoins is 21 millions. Currently 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined which means
                    there are currently 2.5 million Bitcoins left to be mined. If you think
                    about this number then basic knowledge will tell you the price of Bitcoin will increase as time progresses.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Price of Bitcoin</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    In 2009 the public sale of Bitcoin was $1 for 1309.03 Bitcoins. If do you a calculation you will find out the price of Bitcoin
                    was 0.00076 USD. You could get it for less than peanuts if you knew what it would be worth in the future from back then.

               <h2 id="buy-bitcoin" class="card-header">How to buy Bitcoin?</h2>
               <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">
                       There are a number of ways to buy Bitcoin. Bank transfers and cash are the most popular. When you buy Bitcoin, you have to use the currency you reside in to make the purchase.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">1. Bank transfer</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     In many countries this seems to be the best option which gives it the lowest costing fee. Lower fee means higher profit. Exchanges do ask for verification id so be aware of this. Bank transfers are also slow to transfer as it can take
                     up 3 to 7 days.
                   </p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">2. Credit Card</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     Using a Credit Card to pay for Bitcoin is probably the easiest way and you would receive the Bitcoins instantly after you have verified yourself.
                     You can purchase Bitcoin with a Credit Card from Coinbase and Coinmama. Although Coinbase is for Europe, USA, UK, Canada, Australia and Singapore.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/images/Credit-cards.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="credit-card">
                    <h5 class="card-title">3. Debit Card</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     If you decide to use Coinbase to buy Bitcoin with a Debit Card then all you need to do is add the Debit Card number to your Coinbase profile. Verify your identity card and then make the Bitcoin purchase.
                     The problem with Debit Cards is that fees can be high and they do ask for veritfication before any sort of transaction.
                   </p>
                   <h5 class="card-title">4. Cash</h5>
                   <p class="card-text">
                    Buying Bitcoin using cash is the most private way of making a Bitcoin purchase. Please note this has to be somebody you know and trust. If you don't know the person then you should be a using a payment system like Escrow to
                    transfer the Bitcoin. The problem with buying Bitcoin in cash is that you can easily be robbed or scammed.
                  </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">5. Bitcoin ATM</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Purchasing Bitcoin from an ATM Bitcoin machine is very private since no personal information is required to make the purchase but the bad part about this is Bitcoin ATMs usually have a 20% markup cost fee associated with it.
                    Should you have easy access to an ATM Bitcoin machine then go ahead and buy it since it is a fast way to buy Bitcoins.
                   </p>

                  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white">                  The first time you buy Bitcoin will be time consuming. When you a drove car for the first time it was time consuming but after that it got much faster to learn.
                                    The same goes for anything in life, just like Bitcoin, all purchases there on after will become easier.</div>

               <div class="card-body">
                   <p class="card-text">
                     The rise of cryptocurrency Exchanges has made it simple and convenient for people to purchase Bitcoin. Some cryptocurrency brokers have bank transfers, debit and credit cards as service offerings.
                   </p>
                   <h5 class="card-title">1. Limitations - the amount of coins you need to buy</h5>
                     Choose a cryptocurrency exchange when:
                     <ol>
                       <li>You need to buy many coins</li>
                       <li>The coin is only offered on that broker exchange</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5 class="card-title">2. Rate of exchange - buy Bitcoin at the cheapest exchange rate</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     The price of Bitcoin changes and varies all the time from one place to the next. This depends on the exchange rate of currency being used on that exchange. Compare the different prices of the various exchanges and make a a choice.
                   </p>
                   <h5 class="card-title">3. Reputation - purchase Bitcoin without getting scammed</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     Find out if the cryptocurrency exchange you plan to use is well established. Look at the age of the exchange. One of the cryptocurrency exchanges that got famous in a short space of time was Binance.
                   </p>
                   <h5 class="card-title">4. Security - how secure are cryptocurrency exchanges?</h5>
                   <p class="card-text">
                     Ensure the cryptocurrency you choose is fully secure. The exchange needs to support dual authentication with The Google Aunthenticator application. The exchange needs to send an email each time a user logs in to the account.
                   </p>

                     There are roughly three types of cryptocurrency wallets that you should know about. Some experts believe that you only own the Bitcoin if you have access to the encryption keys. If you purchase a wallet to store your cryptocurrencies then this would be a better option for security.
                   </p>
                   <h5 class="card-title">1. Hardware wallets</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                     These are the hardware devices that are built for managing the private key and public key addresses. Most popular hardware wallets allow the consumer to store more than 22 cryptocurrencies and over 500 ERC-20 tokens.

                   Two of the most popular are:
